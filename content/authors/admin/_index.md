Hello, I'm Yang Su, an embedded software engineer.

When I was a freshman, I had a course called C language programming. After the course, I began to think about how to apply C language. Occasionally, I got a book named 51 Single-Chip Microcomputer Tutorial based on C language, which offered me the entry to the world of electronic design. Along with the improvement of ability, I also took part in the Electronic Design Contest which teamed up with three people and you need to fulfill as many requirements as possible in three days. Through the efforts of my team, we achieved good results. 

During undergraduate period, I have done some projects about blockchain applications in IoT. In the future, I would like to do some research about IoT security which may cover the techonology of blockchain and AI.

I am looking for a Phd position now.
