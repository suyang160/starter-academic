abstract: In recent years, the study on the self-balancing car with two wheels is developing rapidly.The design takes MSP430F149 as the core processor, adopting MPU6050 chip to measure the value of the angle and angular acceleration, using the algorithm of Kalman filter and complementary filter to deal with the data, figuring out the real-time speed according to the width of photoelectric sensor’s output pulse, adjusing the motor of the car through the PID algorithm, under the premise of making it in the balance, according to the received infrared signal it makes the car forward, backward, stop or turn．

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
